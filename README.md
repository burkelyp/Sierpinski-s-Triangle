# Sierpinski-s-Triangle

Sierpinski's triangle is a spectral algorithm that is created by following 3 simple rules

The rules to create Sierpinski's Triangle are:

  1: pick a point anywhere in a triangle
  2: randomly choose any vertex in the triangle and plot the following point halfway between that vertex and your previous point
  3: repeat step 2 until the spectral becomes more and more detailed
  
This project first defines an equilateral triangle,
then randomly chooses a point within the triangle,
then, within a loop, randomly chooses a vertex of the triangle and plots the next point.
The loop repeats 100,000 to show a detailed image of the fractal without taking too much time to run.
